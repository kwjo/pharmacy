### Mr HS, 72-year-old, is admitted to hospital with increasing shortness of breath at rest. He has a previous medical history of severe left ventricular systolic dysfunction, confirmed by echocardiog- raphy, and angina. Before admission he had been taking the following medication: lisinopril 10 mg daily, furosemide 80 mg each morning and 40 mg at 2 pm, digoxin 62.5 micrograms each morn- ing, ISMN SR 60 mg daily, glyceryl trinitrate spray 1â€“2 doses as required, aspirin 75 mg dispersible each morning. His chest X-ray shows severe pulmonary oedema, his blood pressure is 110/70 mmHg and serum urea and electrolytes are within normal range. During the admission, carvedilol 3.125 mg twice daily is started

### Q. What therapeutic options would you choose to treat the acute symptoms presented by Mr HS at the beginning of his admission?
- Change PO furosemide to IV furosemide. Why though -> **"PO furosemide absorption is decreased secondary to gastro-intestinal oedema"** + faster onset of action -> effective reduction of the preload (which comes before diuresis)
- Consider addtion of a thiazide diuretic for symptomatic relief


### Q. Was the addition of carvedilol appropriate for this patient?
- As the patient was acutely admitted due to symptomatic worsening of heart failure, the addition of carvedilol (beta blocker) can worsen the heart failure.
- BB should be initiated when the patient's heart failure has been stable for at least 2 weeks and started at a very low dose.

### Q. What other drug treatment options might be considered for this patient in the longer-term? 
- SGLT2i (sprionolactone can be considered)
- An addition of different class of diuretics 
- Given the blood pressure and renal function, potentially increasing lisinopril dose if tolerated but only consider this when the patient's heart failure is stable.

### R.
- Is each medication titrated up to target level and is it appropriate to do it in an acute setting?
- What treatment options are available to resolve the acute issues.
