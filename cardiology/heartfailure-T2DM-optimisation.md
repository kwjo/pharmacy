### Mr GF, a 57-year-old, suffered an MI 12 months ago and at that time was also found to have left ventricular systolic dysfunction on echocardiography. His functional status is currently classed as NYHA II. At your request, he has agreed to see you for a medication review regarding his drug therapy. He has a history of type 2 diabetes mellitus (8 years), and his current prescription include enalapril 10 mg twice daily, gliclazide 80 mg twice daily, bisoprolol 5 mg daily, aspirin 75 mg daily, and a glyceryl trinitrate spray to use when required.
### Q. Is the current treatment plan for heart failure optimal? 
- Consider starting SGLT2i -> monitor sick day, DKA, UTI
- Consider starting given CVD and T2DM -> **regardless of serum cholesterol**
- Enalapril can be titrated up to 10 - 20mg BD
- Bisoprolol can be titrated up to 10mg OD -> **increasing beta-blocker dose may worsen the heart failure symptoms**
- Why is the patient not on any diuretics?
