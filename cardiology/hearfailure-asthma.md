### Mrs FM, a 70-year-old with chronic asthma and mild heart failure, has been prescribed naproxen 250 mg three times daily. On inspection of her medication record, it is discovered that she is also receiving:
- furosemide 40 mg each morning,
- ramipril 5 mg in the morning,
- prednisolone 5 mg daily,
- salbutamol inhaler two puffs four times daily when required,
- salmeterol 50 micrograms inhaler one puff twice daily,
- beclometasone 250 micrograms inhaler two puffs twice daily,
- omeprazole 10 mg daily.
### When asked her about symptom control, she said she is still breathless at night, which, in addition to her painful knee, is keeping her awake.

### Q. Do you think Mrs FM should be taking naproxen?
- Given PMH of asthma, NSAIDs is not preferred for pain control. NSAIDs may cause or worsen breathlessness in asthmatic patients. Why?
- NSAIDs -> exacerbation of heart failure asthmatic bronchospasm by causing fluid retention
- Estbalish whether night time breathlessness is due to ibuprofen.
- GI bleeding risk of steroids


### Q. What other aspects of this patientâ€™s medication regimen could be improved?
- Check inhaler technique
- Establish what is causing her knee pain.
- Is furosemide up to required dose to treat the patient symptomatically? (increase if breathlessness is due to heart failure)
- Potentially titrating ramipril dose up to maximum tolerable dose
- Establish why the patient is on long-term prednisolone (and ensure the patient does not experience adrenal insufficiency)
- Consider adding SGLT2i


### Q. What is the likely effect of the prescribed therapy on serum potassium concentrations?
- Do NSAIDs cause hyperkalaemia? [Frequency not known]
- Increases K+: ramipril (ACEi) 
- Reduces K+: furosemide (loopD), salbutamol (beta agonist), salmeterol (beta agonist), prednisolone (oral steroids), beclomethasone (ICS)
- Monitor K+ if ramipril dose is to be increased.


### R.
- Checking inhaler technique routinely.
- Again and again, ACEi and BB to the maximum tolerable dose for greater benefits on morbidity and mortality.
- Beta-blocker is contraindicated in patients with asthma.
