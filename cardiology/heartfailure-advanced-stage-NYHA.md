### Mr CH, a 78-year-old, regularly visits your pharmacy for his medication and has moderately symptomatic heart failure (NYHA III). During a recent review with his primary care doctor, Mr CH described worsening of his heart failure symptoms. His doctor has said he could take an extra dose of furosemide 40 mg if required, but Mr CH would need to be referred back to the hospital cardiology consultant before changing any other medication. He is currently prescribed ramipril 5 mg daily, nebivolol 2.5 mg daily and furosemide 40 mg daily. His blood pressure has been measured as 103/62 mmHg (heart rate 54 bpm), and he has an eGFR of 30 ml/min/1.73 m2.

### Q. What is the rationale behind the decision to refer Mr CH to the cardiology consultant?

- hypotension + bradycardia -> titrating existing ACEi and BB need careful monitoring and clear reasoning. (is hypotension reading an intermittent reading rather than constant)
- renal function is not particularly nice either. There is a risk of acute renal function decline when ACEi is titrated up.


### Q. What other drug treatment options might be considered?

- SGLT2i, digoxin, entresto (sac/val), ivabradine (all these are not correct)
- answer: "It is unlikely that there will be much scope to add further medi- cation, and optimising either ACE inhibitor or Î²-blocker therapy will be limited due to their effects on blood pressure and/or renal function."

The New York Heart Association (NYHA) Functional Classification is a system used to categorize heart failure based on how much physical activity triggers symptoms. This classification helps in guiding the treatment approach for each stage. Here's an overview of each NYHA class and the general treatment goals associated with them:

- **NYHA Class I**: Patients experience no limitations in ordinary physical activity and do not have symptoms of heart failure during these activities.

- Treatment Goals: The focus is on preventing the progression of heart disease. This includes lifestyle modifications, monitoring for new symptoms, and managing risk factors like hypertension or coronary artery disease.

- **NYHA Class II**: Patients have slight limitations in physical activity. They are comfortable at rest, but ordinary physical activity leads to symptoms like fatigue, palpitations, or shortness of breath.

- Treatment Goals: The aim is to relieve symptoms, prevent worsening of heart failure, maintain a good quality of life, and avoid hospitalization. This often involves optimizing the dosages of heart failure medications and monitoring for side effects.

- **NYHA Class III**: Patients experience marked limitations in physical activity. They are comfortable at rest, but less than ordinary activity causes heart failure symptoms.

- Treatment Goals: The primary objectives are to significantly reduce symptoms, improve exercise tolerance, enhance quality of life, and prevent hospitalization. Treatment might include more aggressive medication management and monitoring, along with non-pharmacological strategies such as dietary and lifestyle changes.

- **NYHA Class IV**: Patients have symptoms of heart failure even at rest, and any physical activity increases discomfort.

- Treatment Goals: In this advanced stage, the focus is on alleviating symptoms as much as possible, managing comorbid conditions, reducing hospitalizations, and considering palliative care approaches to improve the quality of life. Treatment may include advanced therapies like mechanical support or transplant in select cases.
